This lab is designed to be used in a workshop environment with an instructor present. The content is be broken down into “challenges” where each challenge will be a complete use case with a provided solution. Based on the participants experience with Okta and Workflows, they can decide which challenges they would like to complete. This workshop is designed to cater for the new Okta user, through to the more experienced user.

The participants might like to choose challenges that are similar to current use cases within their organization.

The instructor will be stepping through some of the key challenges, and can assist each participant where required.

## Challengers
Here is a list of the challengers included in this lab:

| No | Title | Summary | Difficulty
|--|--|--|--|
| 1 | Joiner Flow | Based on a User Activated event, we look at how we can automate tasks like sending a message to Slack and via Email. | Medium |
| 2 | Mover Flow | Using Okta Workflows we can change a users group membership based on a certain role.  | Medium |
| 3 | Leaver Flow | Based on a User Deactivation event, we are going to look at how we can communicate with an external API endpoint. The challenge also looks at how to parse a JSON object. | Easy |
| 4 | Anything as a Source | Using workflows we are going to connect an external database as a HR system which synchronizes and masters users in Okta. | Medium |
| 5 | Office 365 Guest Users | Using workflows, we are going to automatically provision Office 365 Guest accounts based on group membership in Okta. We also see how guest accounts can be used to provide access to certain applications, like a SharePoint site. |  |
| 6 | Report Suspicious Activity | Using workflows we can automate a number of actions when a user reports suspicious activity, like resetting the users password, ending all the users sessions and reporting the event to security. | Easy |
| 7 | Detect potential Account Takeover | In this challenge, we look at how workflows can detect multiple factor resets within a specified time period. If multiple resets are detected, workflows can suspend the account and notify security. | Easy |
| 8 | Access Certification Campaigns | In this challenge, we look at how Okta's Identity Governance can be used to create an Access Certification Campaign. We create a basic campaign and look at how the users assigned manager can approve or revoke access. | Medium |
| 9 | Access Certification with Workflows | In this challenge, we look at how Okta's Identity Governance integrates with okta Workflows. When revoking a users access to a resource, there might be additional activities that have to be performed. This is where okta Workflows can be used to revoke a users access. | Medium |
| 10 | Access Requests | In this challenge, we look at how Okta's Identity Governance comes with the ability to create an Access Request Workflow | Medium |
