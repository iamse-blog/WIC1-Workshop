# In-Person & Hands-On Workshop

Workflows makes it easy to automate identity processes at scale – without writing code. Organizations can use if-this-then-that logic, Okta's pre-built connectors and template library, and the ability to connect to any publicly available API to enable anyone to innovate with Okta.
  
Okta Identity Governance works in conjunction with Okta Lifecycle Management and Okta Workflows. The all-new Access Governance plays a central role in the solution, simplifying access management tasks, so administrators can make sure the right people have access to the right resources when they need them. Access Governance includes three key features: Access Certification, Access Request and Out of the box reporting capabilities.
  
## What to expect
- Build, Test and Run a Joiner workflow to send notifications via Slack or Teams and Email when employees join your organisation  
- Understand how joiner, mover and leaver processes can be automated using Okta Workflows  
- Learn how Okta Workflows can be used for detecting unusual activities like multiple login attempts or unusual login locations, triggering automatic responses.
- Use Okta Identity Governance to build an approval workflow, see access certification in action and run some attestation reports
